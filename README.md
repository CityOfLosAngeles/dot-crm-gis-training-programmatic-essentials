# Programmatic Data Processing Essentials for GIS Specialists

## **🌟 Goal**

Equip GIS Specialists with foundational R programming skills to streamline their data cleaning and preparation, enabling more efficient workflows with ArcGIS Pro for spatial analysis and map creation.

## **👩🏽‍💻 How**

**Participants will learn:**

- How to structure R Projects for reproducibility
- Write R code in RStudio
- Apply core tidyverse functions to clean and wrangle messy data
- Explore data visualization using ggplot2

Emphasis will be placed on reshaping data into tidy data - a consistent, tabular structure that makes analysis and visualization easier, especially when working with spatial attributes in ArcGIS Pro.

## **💡 Motivation**

Many GIS professionals rely on Excel or manual, one-off methods for preparing spatial data. These processes can be time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to replicate. R programming is a powerful, scriptable, and repeatable way to handle data preparation, saving time and reducing frustration while promoting reproducible workflows that align with data science best practices.
