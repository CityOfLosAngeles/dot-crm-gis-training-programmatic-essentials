This installation guide is based on the Bren School's Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) Program's [MEDS Computing Requirements & Software Installation Guide.](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/MEDS-installation-guide/){target="_blank"}
:::

## 1. Install R {#install-R}

Visit [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} to download the most recent version of R for your operating system. At the time this guide was last updated, version 4.4.3 was the latest.

## 2. Install RStudio {#install-RStudio}

While R is a programming language, RStudio is a software (often referred to as an IDE, **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment) that provides R programmers with a neat, easy-to-use interface for coding in R. There are a number of IDEs out there, but RStudio is arguably the best and definitely most popular among R programmers.

::: {.callout-tip}
## You need *both* R and RStudio installed
RStudio will not work without R installed, and you won't particularly enjoy using R without having RStudio installed. Be sure to install *both*!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"

knitr::include_graphics("images/installation_1_RStudio_to_R.png")
```

- **New install:** To install RStudio, visit [posit.co/downloads/](https://posit.co/downloads/){target="_blank"}. Download the free (“Open Source Edition”) Desktop version for your operating system. Be sure to install the most up-to-date version available.

- **Launch RStudio:** Ensure RStudio opens and is running properly.

::: {#tip-install-rtools .callout-tip collapse=false}
### Windows Users: You may need to install RTools

**If you see a warning message after running `install.packages()`, install RTools.**

- **To install RTools,** visit [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/){target="_blank"} and select the version based on the RStudio version you're running. 
    - **Note:** If you have an older version of RTools already downloaded on your computer, you may be prompted to delete it first.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
### Mac Users: You may need to install command line tools and XQuartz. 
   
**If RStudio prompts you to install Command Line Tools upon opening, go ahead and install them.**

  - **To install command line tools** (if you’re not automatically prompted), run `xcode-select --install` in the RStudio Terminal
  - **To install XQuartz,** visit [xquartz.org](https://www.xquartz.org/){target="_blank"}

*Windows users: Windows machines should already have command line tools installed, and XQuartz is only required for Macs.*
:::

## 3. Updating RStudio

If you already have RStudio and need to update, open RStudio, and under *Help* (in the top menu), choose *Check for updates*. If you have the most recent release, it will return *No update available. You are running the most recent version of RStudio*. Otherwise, you should follow the instructions to install an updated version.

You can also find the most up-to-date release of RStudio available for download at [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

You might need to update your RTools as well, see @tip-install-rtools.

### Check that you have the right RStudio Version running

After installing the update, open RStudio and look at your Console to see what version is running:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"

knitr::include_graphics("images/1_updating_rstudio.png")
```

If you notice an older version is running, go to Tools in the top menu bar and click "Global Options":

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"

knitr::include_graphics("images/2_updating_rstudio.png")
```

In the Global Options window, make sure you're in General and click the "Change" button next to the "R version" field under the "R Sessions" header:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"

knitr::include_graphics("images/3_updating_rstudio.png")
```

The "Choose R Installation" window will appear, and you can either choose the default option or you can specify a specific version of R. Either one works, then click "Ok". You'll be told to quit and restart RStudio for the changes to go into effect.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"

knitr::include_graphics("images/4_updating_rstudio.png")
```

### 4. Install Quarto *if necessary* (automatically installed with RStudio) {#Quarto}

Quarto is a scientific publishing tool built on Pandoc that allows R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS users to create dynamic documents, websites, books and more.  

Quarto is included with RStudio v2022.07.1+ **so there no need for a separate download/install** if you have the latest version of RStudio! You can find all releases (current, pre, and older releases) on the Quarto website [download page](https://quarto.org/docs/download/){target="_blank"}, should you want/need to reference them.
