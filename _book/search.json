These processes can be time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to replicate. R programming is a powerful, scriptable, and repeatable way to handle data preparation, saving time and reducing frustration while promoting reproducible workflows that align with data science best practices.",

    "text": "2. Install RStudio\nWhile R is a programming language, RStudio is a software (often referred to as an IDE, Integrated Development Environment) that provides R programmers with a neat, easy-to-use interface for coding in R. There are a number of IDEs out there, but RStudio is arguably the best and definitely most popular among R programmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need both R and RStudio installed\n\n\n\nRStudio will not work without R installed, and you won‚Äôt particularly enjoy using R without having RStudio installed. Be sure to install both!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Exploratory Data Analysis in R, by Manny Gimond\n\n\n\n\nNew install: To install RStudio, visit posit.co/downloads/. Download the free (‚ÄúOpen Source Edition‚Äù) Desktop version for your operating system. Be sure to install the most up-to-date version available.\n\n\n\nLaunch RStudio: Ensure RStudio opens and is running properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac Users: You may need to install command line tools and XQuartz.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf RStudio prompts you to install Command Line Tools upon opening, go ahead and install them.\n\nTo install command line tools (if you‚Äôre not automatically prompted), run xcode-select --install in the RStudio Terminal\nTo install XQuartz, visit xquartz.org\n\nWindows users: Windows machines should already have command line tools installed, and XQuartz is only required for Macs.",
